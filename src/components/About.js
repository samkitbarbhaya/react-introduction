            I am a software developer with a particular interest in making things simple and concise. 
            I try to make the code scaleable and keep up with the best practices, and am always looking for new technologies to learn.
            I have an experience in working as a data engineer at Fractal Analytics where I was involved in the data warehousing and migration projects.
            I am comfortable to code in C++ as well as Python.
